## üîç Project Overview

* **Purpose:** Enable consulting businesses to present their core offerings‚Äîstrategy consulting, digital transformation, operational excellence, and risk management‚Äîin an immersive, modern web experience.
* **Architecture:** Built with Create React App (CRA) and configured via CRACO for customization without ejecting.
* **Key Concepts:**

  * **Component-driven UI:** Modular React components ensure reusability and maintainability.
  * **3D Scenes:** Three.js (via @react-three/fiber) delivers interactive 3D models or backgrounds in the hero and features sections.
  * **Motion & Transitions:** Framer Motion & framer-motion-3d animate elements on scroll and user interactions for a polished feel.
  * **Data Counters:** Dynamic number counters visualize statistics (e.g., consultants onboarded, projects completed).
  * **Email Integration:** EmailJS enables secure, client-side message delivery from the contact form without back-end infrastructure.
